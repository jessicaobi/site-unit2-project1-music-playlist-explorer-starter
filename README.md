Updated Message:
Hello CodePath Team! My loom has not been working correctly for the past two weeks, and I was originally unable to login on my work laptop using my Salesforce email. Additionally, the Loom website kept me in a limbo where I wasn't able to sign in or out, and it was just a loading page. This happened last week as well. I tried to load the code on my personal laptop, but it wasn't working either due to me not being able to fork from my own repository. I still submitted my original project although the walkthrough video was not there, which is noted in my submission notes. This walkthrough video section is the only part of the github repository that has been edited since my timely submission. I was able to finally log into Loom on a private browser using my personal account after about an hour of trial and error with the account I originally intended to use, so I sincerely apologize for any potential inconvenience. Thank you all so much for your understanding!

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think they did. Although, I would also say that we went through everything very quckly. I think we could've spent more time on the JSON or even went through it more slowly, but for the amount of stuff that we had to do in this project, we genuinely did not have enough time.


* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I think I would add more animations and try to complete more stretch goals such as the add, edit, sort, and search features. I definitely think that would add to the variety of the page and make it seem less static. Another thing that I would have tried to implement a feature where when you clicked or hovered over a specific song in the modal or on the featured page that it would actually play the song, or link you to Spotify. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think the JSON file and HTML wireframe did not go as planned. In hindsight, I definitely would have read through all of the milestones before spending so much time of the wireframe. I think it was redundant to do the initial wireframe if we were going to add it dynamically anyways. I think that took away a lot of time.

One thing that I do think I did well was the shuffle button. It was my most prideful feature because I did it with absolutely zero AI assistance. Although AI is encouraged in this program, I don't like to use it too much when programming because I like the problem-solving aspect of coding and taking my time. However, because this program is so fast-paced, you genuinely don't have the time to sit there and try to figure everything out by yourself without AI assistance from some things. So being able to do all of that by myself really made me happy.

As mentioned in the previous question, I would like to implement a feature where when you clicked or hovered over a specific song in the modal or on the featured page that it would actually play the song, or link you to Spotify. During the project demos, I saw a few of my peers do that, and I thought it was a great and cool idea.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I would like to shout out Devarsh for walking us through the JSON lesson and application for this project. He also helped with my JS file for the Featured page as I didn't know it was general convention to have a seperate js file for each html file. I would also like to shoutout my peer Moosay for giving me the idea to link the image to it‚Äôs ID when naming. This made saving and uploading pictures significantly quicker.
